Project Description: This game will be a top down 3rd person shooter. 
It will have three levels with an endless mode as well. The enemies will 
become stronger based on which level you are on,and in the endless mode, 
the enemies will gradually become stronger over time, as there are no set levels.

2.    There will be a way the enemies spawn in (i.e. randomly, spawn points, walk in from outside of screen) 
3.    The user should be able to aim and shoot these enemies and depending on if the enemy was hit the enemy will despawn
4.    Enemies should have an A* mapping/search function to track the player
A way for enemies to track and move towards the character
